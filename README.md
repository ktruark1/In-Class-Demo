# In-Class-Demo

In the next two months, I want to build software that…

Is helpful for school.

I don’t know if this has already been done, but I would like to be able to compress a video into a file like a picture that I can put into my notes, so that I can take screen recordings of my notes and have them as a reference while I have my notes pulled up

Otherwise is an app that will help with making profiles for sports that I send to colleges. I have a player profile that I constantly update on my MacBook, and I think that it would be really helpful if I could make the process of editing it a lot quicker. At this point, I don’t really know how I could make it easier or more convenient, but it is tedious to update it a lot and send emails.
